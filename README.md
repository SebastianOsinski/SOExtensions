SOExtensions is a collection of convenient and useful extensions for Swift classes and structs. This is not 'full-time' project. New extensions will be added with time when the need for them will arise in my other projects.

## Installation

SOExtensions is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
