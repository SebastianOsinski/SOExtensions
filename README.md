SOExtensions is a collection of convenient and useful extensions for Swift classes and structs. This is not a 'full-time' project. New extensions will be added in time if and when the need for them arises in my other projects.

## Installation

SOExtensions is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SOExtensions"
